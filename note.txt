hello

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
1. User Session & Authentication Flow
Make sure your frontend (JavaFX) securely stores and sends the JWT token after login.

Use the token to authenticate subsequent requests.

Implement logout functionality (invalidate or delete token on client side).

2. User Profile & Contacts
Allow users to edit their profile (display name, avatar, status message).

Implement fetching and displaying a list of contacts or friends.

Add functionality to search users to add as contacts or start chats with.

3. Creating Conversations / Chat Rooms
Design and implement chat entities in backend: Conversations (1:1 or group chats), Messages.

Add API endpoints to:

Create new chat/conversation.

Fetch chat list for the logged-in user.

Fetch messages for a specific chat.

4. Sending and Receiving Messages
Implement sending messages API.

Design message model with attributes like senderId, content, timestamp, status (sent, delivered, read).

On the frontend, display message history in chat window.

5. Real-Time Messaging
For a real-time chat experience, add WebSocket support:

Use Spring WebSocket or STOMP protocol on the backend.

JavaFX client can use a WebSocket client to connect and listen for new messages.

Real-time updates for new messages, typing indicators, and presence status.

6. Message Persistence and Pagination
Store messages in your database.

Support fetching messages in pages (load earlier messages on scroll).

7. Additional Features
Typing indicators, read receipts.

Group chats with multiple users.

Push notifications (if applicable).

File/image sharing.

User online/offline status.

Next Step I recommend right now:
Implement the Chat / Conversation model and backend API to send and fetch messages

Define entities: Conversation, Message

Build REST endpoints:

Create conversation

Get user conversations

Get messages in a conversation

Send message to a conversation

Example backend API design:

Method	URL	Description
POST	/api/conversations	Create new chat (1:1 or group)
GET	/api/conversations	Get all chats of logged user
GET	/api/conversations/{id}/messages	Get messages for a chat
POST	/api/conversations/{id}/messages	Send message to chat
